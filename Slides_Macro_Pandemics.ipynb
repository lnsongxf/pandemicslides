As a monopsony (sole buyer/employer) it could set and enforce low wages. By comparison Egypt in 6th-8th centuries saw a series of Epidemics and wages doubled (we think, data is rough), at this time land was held directly by individuals so landlords competed to hire."

(Thomas Malthus, and Malthusian Economics; population mattered for incomes. Since Industrial Revolution level of population matters very little.)\n",
    "- But may see similar effect in certain sectors: e.g., farming in New Zealand is dependent on migrant labor (both Pacific Islanders on temporary work visas and Europeans looking to extend working holiday visas), current travel restrictions have caused large decrease in supply of both so will likely see wages rise."
